You experimented with the impact of different sized of hidden layer, number of training epochs etc on the final accuracy.  For convenience, here's the entire code again. Run it and take a note of the test accuracy that is printed out at the end. #Improving Computer Vision Accuracy using Convolutions  In the previous lessons you saw how to do fashion recognition using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) containing three layers -- the input layer (in the shape of the data), the output layer (in the shape of the desired output) and a hidden layer.
